        <h2>Updates on A-OKAY project</h2>

        <p>01.01 - Happy New Year! A-OKAY project has officially been launched today. The replica has been inserted
            in subject's telecommunication devices and should be active as of now. No action has been made yet. Awaiting updates.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           01.04 - The replica has replied to three professional emails today. No suspicion from subject has been denoted yet. The replica
        has yet to insert itself in personal conversations. So far, resemblance in tone and personality are uncanny. 
        </p>

        <p>01.05 - Patch note: Simple bugs have been fixed. Replica still undercover for now.</p>
        <p>01.13 - First personal interaction today. Did not go exactly as planned. Contact was alerted and decided 
            to call subject directly. We do not know as of yet if subject is suspecting something or not. Updates to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            01.14 - Subject's account has been reported. The replica will require more training before being relaunched. Close friends have been getting suspicious.
        </p>
        <p>
            01.27 - The replica has been relaunched after careful adjustments. The replica seems to have matched the subject's tone satisfyingly 
            in last message. No new suspicion arised. Will keep a close watch for now.
        </p>
        <p>02.01 - The replica has been taken down momentarily for trouble-shooting. Will be back soon.</p>
        <p>02.02 - The replica is back on. Patch note has been published to separate network.</p>
        <p>02.14 - The replica has been very active for the past two weeks. Subject has shown notable concern, but we are being careful as to not be detected. Everything is going 
            according to plan. Currently preparing for Phase 2. See file for additional details.
        </p>
        <p> 02.25 - Subject has been increasingly agitated, but nothing can lead back to us or to project A-OKAY. We have been 
            covering our tracks carefully. 
        </p>
        <p> 02.27 - Preparation for phase 2 is well underway. The replica's image has been subject to intense testing in 
            our labs. 78 out of 100 test subjects do not see a difference to the main subject. We are planning a launch 
            on March 31st.
        </p>
        <p>03.01 - Project has been halted due to public concerns. They are being dealt with. Waiting for permission to 
            continue.
        </p>
        <p>03.20 - Phase 2 almost ready to launch. Testing has been resumed two weeks ago. Subject is being heavily surveilled.</p>
        <p>03.29 - The replica is set to give an interview in the place of the subject after this year's edition of the Statera CyberRace. 
            Preparation is going well. Subject will soon be disposed of if all goes well.
        </p>
        <p>03.31 - Phase 2 has successfully been launched. Update will follow quickly.</p>
        <p>03.31 - Subject is no where to be found. Intense research is in progress. Phase 2 might be suspended.</p>
        <p>04.07 - Nothing has been heard from subject in the past week. Radio silence. The replica has no choice but to stay 
            active. Search for subject is relentless. Worry has been arising in 
            online circles. We cannot deal with public outrage at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>04.20 - Subject still missing. Phase 2 is successful nonetheless. The replica is surpassing expectations. Search 
            for subject continues.
        </p>
