        <h3>Okay. What is this really about? </h3>
        <p class="small-p">A-OKAY is the title of an indie 2D-animated short film that I directed and animated in my last year at Concordia University, Montreal. It’s about a girl named Mars going up against an evil clone of herself in an epic physical fight set between the real world and the cyberspace.</p>
        <p class="small-p">But beyond that, the A-OKAY-verse is a cyberpunk universe in which multiple characters, corporations and conflicts coexist through various different stories.</p>

        </section>

        <p class="small-p">The present website is meant as a tool to expend the A-OKAY universe beyond the constraints of the two minutes film. It is meant to both accompany and transcend the film, in a way, allowing users and viewers alike to explore the world of Mars and figure out the shady secrets behind her ultimate face-off.</p>
        <p class="small-p">In the process of making this website, I was inspired by the concept of augmented reality games, or ARGs, which allow fans of specifics medias to band together in scavenger hunt-like games with the goal of solving mysteries engaging with the media beyond its original text. It is why certain secrets are hidden throughout this site, which only the most attentive hunters will be able to uncover.</p>

        </section>
        
        <p class="small-p">A-OKAY as a whole is about a lot of things, but first and foremost it’s about facing what you fear most, and sometimes in the process becoming the very embodiment of that fear. It’s about corporatization, the loss of oneself, and corruption. Hey, it’s all going to be A-OKAY in the end; but at what cost?</p>
