ABOUT

10 year of A-OKAY
10 years ago, a revolutionary clothing brand saw the light and brought together a community of optimists
with a passion for high quality street fashion and an unshakable faith in a brighter future. Let's take
a look back into the history of the A-OKAY phenomenon.

Humble beginnings
Back in 2040, young independant artist and entrepreneur [redacted] had an idea for a clothing collection
that would promote positive values and bring people together through believing that things could get better. 
"Everyone was feeling low, my friends were depressed, the economy was shit...we all needed something to hold
on to, we needed a community to fight this nation-wide glass-half-empty kind of feeling." [redacted] resorted
to what he knew best: fashion design. "I made a few shirts on my personal press for my friends and coworkers. I called it "A-OKAY",

Every popular store wanted to have the A-OKAY brand name on their shelves. With the increasing popularity of the
brand, [redacted] was able to acquire the first A-OKAY manufacture, and expanded the brand from graphic tees
to tank tops, pants, and even accessories like hats and bags. 

A lifechanging collab
A-OKAY struck gold when they offered to sponsor beloved racecar driving superstar Mars [blank], known professionally as MARS,
on her 2044 participation to the international Statera Cyber Race. The famous driver contributed to building immense hype around
the already popular brand by embodying its fun, optimistic and hopeful message. A-OKAY sales blew up following
the long-awaited sports events, and A-OKAY apparel was spotted on numerous celebrities from the runways to the streets. 

An exciting change 
In 2046, A-OKAY was officially acquired by Statera Co, the prestigious cutting-edge tech giant. Although
many were confused at first as to what the tech company had to do with a fashion brand, but
