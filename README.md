<h1>A-OKAY project</h1> 

*Everything's gonna be A-OKAY. Are you ready for it?*

Hi hi! This project is meant to be a companion website for an animated film I am currently directing at Concordia University, Montreal. It will serve both a promotional
and narrative purpose and is inspired by the concept alternate reality games (ARGs).

I have little experience in web design or ARG making so this is very much a new learning experience for me. I look forward to sharing more of the process here:)
