            <h3>Humble beginnings</h3>
            <p>Back in 2040, young independant artist and entrepreneur [redacted] had an idea for a clothing collection
                that would promote positive values and bring people together through believing that things could get better. 
                "Everyone was feeling low, my friends were depressed, the economy was shit...we all needed something to hold
                on to, we needed a community to fight this nation-wide glass-half-empty kind of feeling." [redacted] resorted
                to what he knew best: fashion design. "I made a few shirts on my personal press for my friends and coworkers. I called it "A-OKAY",
                as in, 'it's all gonna be A-OKAY, don't panic, things will get better.' We had this DIY fashion show with just
                a few people and the energy was heart-warming. Big smiles, so much hope, we had this party after and 
                everyone was just so excited, we pitched ideas to make the world a little better and to take care of ourselves
                too...great moment really, felt so refreshing to experience"</p>

            <h3>The start of the A-OKAY movement</h3>
            <p>Rapidly, word-of-mouth did its thing and everyone was talking about A-OKAY around town. You couldn't walk 
                10 meters outside without seeing someone with those DIY-printed t-shirts, and not just on the youth - people of all ages
                were adopting the A-OKAY state of mind. "I think everyone was getting really sick of this moody feeling that
                was kind of the norm at the time", [redacted] commented in an interview with a fashion magazine of that time.
                Every popular store wanted to have the A-OKAY brand name on their shelves. With the increasing popularity of the
                brand, [redacted] was able to acquire the first A-OKAY manufacture, and expanded the brand from graphic tees
                to tank tops, pants, and even accessories like hats and bags. </p>

            <h3>A lifechanging collab</h3>
            <p>A-OKAY struck gold when they offered to sponsor beloved racecar driving superstar Mars Zepp, known professionally as MARS,
                on her 2044 participation to the international Statera Cyber Race. The famous driver contributed to building immense hype around
                the already popular brand by embodying its fun, optimistic and hopeful message. A-OKAY sales blew up following
                the long-awaited sports events, and A-OKAY apparel was spotted on numerous celebrities from the runways to the streets.</p>

            <h3>Exciting changes</h3>
            <p>In 2046, A-OKAY was officially acquired by Statera Co, the prestigious cutting-edge tech giant. A few fans were confused at first as to what the tech company had to do with a fashion brand,
                but quickly it became obvious that Statera was the perfect partner to allow the brand to grow and expand
                while remaining independant enough to keep its authentic message and values.</p>
