        <p>04.20 - Subject still missing. Phase 2 is successful nonetheless. The replica is surpassing expectations. Search 
            for subject continues.
        </p>        
        <p>04.07 - Nothing has been heard from subject in the past week. Radio silence. The replica has no choice but to stay 
            active. Search for subject is relentless. Worry has been arising in 
            online circles. We cannot deal with public outrage at the moment.
        </p>        
        <p>03.31 - Subject is no where to be found. Intense research is in progress. Phase 2 might be suspended.</p>

        <p>03.31 - Phase 2 has successfully been launched. Update will follow quickly.</p>

            <h3>Subject</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Full name: Marceline "Mars" Zepp</li>
                <li>Age: 26</li>
                <li>Status: Missing</li>
            </ul>        
            <p>Marceline Zepp has been a loyal representant of the A-OKAY brand name from its independant origins
            to its recent acquisition by Statera Co. However, her behaviors in the past few years have been contradictory 
            to what A-OKAY stands for. She has been chosen by Statera higher ups to be the first subject in the research 
            experiment known as A-OKAY project, a never-seen-before AI experiment with the goal of replacing certain of a 
            popular figure's private and public interactions with those of a clone, or replica. The research was started in 
            January of 2047 and the project was officially deployed three years later on January 1st, 2050.
