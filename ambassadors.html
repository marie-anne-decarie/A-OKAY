            <h3>BASSLINE KAT</h3>
            <p>Very little is known about the true identity of Bassline Kat, the mysterious DJ that's been popping up
                all around town and setting fire to venue after venue (sometimes literally) in the past few months. What we know about them? They have biiiiiig plans for the future,
                and they enthusiastically accepted to be the newest addition to A-OKAY's multiple faces. Or, helmets. Whatever.
