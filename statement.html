        <h3>Everythingâ€™s going to be A-OKAY. Are you ready for it?</h3>

        <p class="small-p">
            A-OKAY is about a girl named Mars going up against an evil digital clone of herself in a limbo area between reality and the cyberspace.

            For me, making this film was about creating something bold, exciting. I love action scenes. I love choreographed fights. I love the cyberpunk genre, which I think is getting more relevant than ever every passing minute. Putting all this love and energy and passion into one epic two-minutes film is the reason I make art in the first place. It is, to put it straight-forwardly, my favorite thing ever.
